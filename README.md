This is an interactive demo made in Python using a Jupyter Notebook.  In order to access the notebook, you can install Jupter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/install) on your personal computer, or follow the Binder link on our Blackboard page.

This Notebook will model the vibration of a damped pendulum and explore the small angle approximation.
